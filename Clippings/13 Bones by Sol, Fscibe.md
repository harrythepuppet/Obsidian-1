I LOVED this one and I am trying to convince people I know to play it. Definitely there's a high luck component, (I either flatten my enemies outright or have to earn it) but I did feel like my tactics mattered enough that I wasn't just pulling a slot machine lever.

Music was especially good, and I liked the lore for the various enemies, very cute stuff.

A downloadable version of this would be nice, as others have said, and I'd love if it was longer, too.

Thank you for making it!

This was really fun! I had to retry the boss twice to win but I ended up getting it first run!!! I do have to say it probably massively comes down to rng cause I felt like I wasn't strategising so much as just trying to get the combo number higher and deck fixing out all high cards lmao.

I'm pretty sure this is a glitch but I can't see any of the numbers or descriptions of cards? I can only see it when I hover over them but I don't think that's intended.![](https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzI1MTM0MDE2LnBuZw==/original/BomRqd.png)

Ok one more bug found. My max handsize was 16 because I had plus one handsize on both four and five and I drew a six making it 14 and it told me I had busted?

Played a ton of Slay the spire (which, I have to say, wasn't as pretty as 13 bones) back in the days and this gives me huuuuge vibes coupled with that eerie Inscryption feeling. I loved your game and can't wait for new mechanics. Do you wan't to share a bit of what is ahead?

In other hand I don't think that it is unfair, for the recod i beat it second try, but the discard mechanics should defienitly be put upfront as this is so game changer

Best of luck!!!

Hey! thanks a lot!  
We need to do a tutorial, but:  
\* you get +1 Combo if you perfect  
\* you get +1 Combo if your enemy bust  
\* some symbols increase your combo (notably for enemies, check the tooltip of their skills)

[Wired Pixels](https://itch.io/profile/wiredpixels) [4 days ago](https://itch.io/post/15313910) (+1)

Really cool game, but the last boss feels unfairly unbalanced, even if you get an amazing deck, just one wrong roll and you lose. If I play like 20 times I'll eventually beat it, but it's so relying on RNG that's not even fun or worth the grind, it's a matter of just getting lucky. Maybe the max for the boss should be 14, or get me an upgrade to get to max 14 (I don't think there is, is there?)

Other than that, great game, I wish it had more balanced content like more paths to explore, more buffs/debuffs, more enemies but with a more balanced math.

![](https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzI1MTAwNjc4LnBuZw==/original/bOMjuG.png) The only strategy that works for me is a rerolling based deck and hope to get all perfects to beat the last boss. Every upgrade I choose rerolls (if there's no reroll then I choose heal) and the strat is to stay at or below 7 and reroll for 13

[Wired Pixels](https://itch.io/profile/wiredpixels) [1 day ago](https://itch.io/post/15333693)

Yeah after a few more tries I beat the boss. And as a reward I had to imagine the ending, lol.

I think I did it with a combination of attack, defense and heal. I tried bones but they're unreliable.

[BigKromerShot](https://itch.io/profile/bigkromershot) [5 days ago](https://itch.io/post/15310201)

Super good game, really like the unique art style, but I had a couple of issues in playing this on my Chromebook:  
  
The right and top-most parts of my screen were cut off, not too much of a big deal, but I couldn't see some of the hints while playing:d  
  
Second issue: My cursor in-game was offset slightly upwards than what my mouse actually was, and this made the game a bit annoying to play, especially because I could barely click the End button!  
  
Apart from those issues, I think you've made an absolutely fun and amazing game. I think that the next step would be to add some more content, but I am aware that you're still fixing bugs and generally making the game better:D  
Really good work, keep it up!

This was so fun!!! Even at the relatively small scale it feels like there's a lot of room for player expression. For example, I did a run where I had cursed double reroll threes and deleted all my sixes and fives, so I had really strong probability manipulation.

If you're interested in expanding this, I'd definitely be interested in playing A LOT more.

[chippythewhitecat](https://itch.io/profile/chippythewhitecat) [8 days ago](https://itch.io/post/15283304) (-1)

Other than one minor visual bug (reported it) the ONLY major complaint is how unfair the final boss is.

\--------------------

**too long; didn't read: Either nerf him, buff the player, allow armour to reduce attacks to 0, give power ups that allow you to bust your enemy by adding attack or allow hand size to be increased again (don't know if it was bad rng or you removed that ability but only got a card that reduced handsize)**  

\--------------------

Granted beat the update in one run but had to lose all the lives and beat the boss on the final one. It feels disproportionately more difficult and feels more rng than the previous enemies despite being a card game with luck.

The only major strategy for newer players to give is to only upgrade health and damage but to never die and loss a life until the final boss. Even still, on death you basically redo the level or choose to restart the entire run opposed to continuing the fight with progress saved.

Like one time got a perfect 13 only to be pelted with 15ish damage because the boss got a perfect 15. The only saving grace is when he busts (usually never) or deal the same card attack to make a draw.

Other than that, it is a fine game.

After getting my ass kicked by the final boss twice pretty badly it felt so perfect to absolutely steamroll it with 3 perfect hands and overkill it by like 10 damage lol

Really fun concept, and definetly one that has potential to be expanded! The final boss can absolutely go fuck itself though.

Oh, this is frustrating. See, the armor upgrade fails to reduce damage to 0 under any circumstance, but *does not tell me this*, so I have what should by rights be an invincible build (3 armor) to slowly chip the Master down, but I simply don't have the bust limit to beat her in the game as actually implemented. I would have made different build choices if I'd known.

This is such a great game! I love it!

You adapted the rules of blackjack brilliantly and the aesthetic is just the right amount of off putting. Keep up the great work. I am going to download the beta.

Some notes:

- The way the +X to maximum before bust is poorly explained. Does it apply to the current turn or the next turn?
- Would love some keyboard controls. It makes sense to have the hit/stay on opposite sides of the interface, but I find it gets in the way of the flow of the game to use the mouse.
- I suggest implementing A for hit, F for stay at least.
- For accessibility points, tab/arrow to cycle through elements on the screen.
