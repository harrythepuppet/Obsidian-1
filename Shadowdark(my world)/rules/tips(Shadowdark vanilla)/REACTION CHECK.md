When the characters encounter random creatures, the GM rolls for the creatures' attitude (if it would not already be clear). 

If the characters immediately interact with the creatures to influence their attitude, one of the interacting characters may add their Charisma modifier to the reaction check. The interacting characters reveal their presence and position to the creatures. Some vicious creatures, such as undead, are always hostile. 

### TREASURE 
There's a 50% chance a randomly encountered creature (or group of creatures) has no treasure.
