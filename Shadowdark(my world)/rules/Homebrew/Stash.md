Stashes are magical chests that transport your loot to any other stash:
- Stash has only 1 point of inventory and you can not change that
- Stashes are located in ANY city\post with TAVERN if you are renting a bed or in your homebase
- Every time you want to take an item back from stash you roll D12, if hit 1, item is lost

Lorewise you should tell players about item transporting system of pipes
